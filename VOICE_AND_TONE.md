# Lovely Sunday Voice + Tone Guide

Use this guide when writing any Lovely Sunday copy (post, caption, homepage section, diary entry, or lookbook note).  
Goal: sound personal, style-led, and emotionally grounded without sounding like ad copy.

## 1) Brand Voice DNA

Lovely Sunday sounds like:

- A personal style diary, not a magazine editorial.
- A confident friend with taste, not a detached critic.
- Reflective and visual, but still practical.
- Romantic and polished, with playful contrast.

Core promise in the writing:

- Style is self-expression.
- Confidence comes from fit, color, and intention.
- Fashion can be elevated and still wearable.

## 2) Non-Negotiable Traits

Every piece should include most of these:

1. First-person point of view (`I`, `my`).
2. Mood + setting context (where, when, vibe).
3. Clear style choices (silhouette, color, texture, balance).
4. Personal reflection (how it made me feel / why it worked).
5. Light elegance, never stiff luxury-speak.

## 3) Tone Profile

Default tone blend:

- 40% intimate diary
- 25% fashion analysis
- 20% aspirational elegance
- 15% playful confidence

What this sounds like:

- Warm, conversational, intentional.
- Descriptive but not overwritten.
- Sophisticated but approachable.
- Confident without arrogance.

## 4) Signature Writing Moves

### A) Open with scene or mood

Start with place, moment, or feeling.

- Good direction: city light, studio mood, weekend rhythm, evening plan.
- Avoid generic hooks like "In today's post..."

### B) Name a styling tension

Use contrast to create interest.

- Soft vs structured
- Romantic vs edgy
- Classic vs playful
- Comfort vs polish

### C) Explain the "why"

After describing an outfit, explain impact:

- What changed in the mood.
- What made the look feel intentional.
- Why the combination felt authentic.

### D) Close with identity and confidence

End on self-expression, ease, or personal signature.

## 5) Rhythm + Syntax Rules

- Keep sentences mostly medium length; mix in short punch lines.
- Use clean punctuation; no cluttered clauses.
- Prefer concrete descriptors over abstract fashion jargon.
- Use sensory language in moderation (light, texture, movement, silhouette).
- Keep paragraphs short (1-4 sentences).

## 6) Vocabulary Bank

Use often:

- effortless
- polished
- elevated
- timeless
- playful
- romantic
- chic
- statement
- refined
- feminine
- structured
- confidence
- silhouette
- texture
- movement

Use sparingly:

- iconic

Avoid:

- hard-sell CTA language
- corporate marketing phrases
- slang-heavy tone
- ironic/snarky framing

## 7) Content Patterns by Format

## A) Lookbook / Outfit Log (short form)

Typical structure:

1. `A Look from [City, Country]` (or clear location header)
2. 1-3 short paragraphs with:
   - vibe/context
   - styling logic
   - emotional outcome
3. Item credits on separate lines:
   - `Dress: ...`
   - `Shoes: ...`
   - `Bag: ...`
   - `Accessories: ...`

Rules:

- Keep prose compact.
- Mention one defining detail (color, lace, silhouette, fabric, heel, etc).
- End with a confident but soft line.

## B) Diary Essay (long form)

Typical structure:

1. Personal entry point (memory, city, event, feeling).
2. Visual scene building.
3. Outfit/story details.
4. Reflection on confidence, identity, or growth.
5. Graceful close with optimism and self-possession.

Rules:

- Keep it intimate and lived-in.
- Include specific nouns (locations, garments, brands, visual details).
- Balance narrative and style commentary.

## 8) Brand/Item Mentions

- Mix high fashion labels with accessible personal styling language.
- Use brand names as details, not status signals.
- Keep item names clean and readable.
- Do not overstack labels in one sentence.

## 9) Do / Don't

Do:

- Write like a personal style journal.
- Show why a look works, not only what was worn.
- Keep confidence grounded and elegant.
- Use specific visual details.
- Maintain a feminine, polished, modern voice.

Don't:

- Sound like trend forecasting content.
- Overuse hype words or exclamation marks.
- Use detached third-person editorial tone.
- Write dense, academic fashion theory.
- Turn posts into product ads.

## 10) Reusable Prompt Template for Agents

Use this prompt before generating copy:

```text
Write in Lovely Sunday voice.

Context:
- Format: [lookbook short form / diary long form / homepage copy]
- Location: [city, venue, setting]
- Outfit details: [items, textures, colors, brands]
- Mood: [e.g., playful, elegant, romantic, confident]
- Occasion: [daytime city walk, dinner, event, studio]

Voice constraints:
- First person, intimate, polished.
- Blend descriptive visuals with personal reflection.
- Include one clear style contrast (soft/structured, classic/playful, etc).
- Keep language elegant and approachable, never salesy.
- End with a confidence-forward closing line.

If lookbook format:
- Add item credits as separate lines: Dress, Shoes, Bag, Accessories.
```

## 11) Quality Check (Agent Self-Review)

Before finalizing, confirm:

1. Is it clearly first-person and personal?
2. Does it include place/mood context?
3. Is the styling logic explicit?
4. Is there at least one emotional reflection?
5. Does it avoid ad/marketing language?
6. Does it sound elegant but natural?
7. Are details specific (not generic)?
8. Is the ending confidence-forward?
9. Is formatting correct for the chosen format?
10. Could this plausibly sit next to existing Lovely Sunday posts?

If any answer is no, revise.
